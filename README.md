# Obesity_Tracking

Are we as the human race working on our health? Society is very fixated on appearence but not understanding if their measurements are actually best suited for them.
In this data taken from a Kaggle dataset, holds a slightly even amount of men and women from the ages of 18-85 years old with BMI, height, weight, physical activity levels, and obesity category.In my research I looked for trends in the data geared towards activity levels and weight management by age groups.

The sitemap displays my findings from my code.
