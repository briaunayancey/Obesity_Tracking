# Obesity_Tracking

Are we as the human race working on our health? Society is very fixated on appearence but not understanding if their measurements are actually best suited for them.
In this data taken from a Kaggle dataset, holds a slightly even amount of men and women from the ages of 18-85 years old with BMI, height, weight, physical activity levels, and obesity category.In my research I looked for trends in the data geared towards activity levels and weight management by age groups.


According to my findings, physical activity is slightly more frequent in women. However women struggle with overweight issues more than women.
Physical activity is not equal to exercise or an exercise regimen for that matter. The 1-4 scale gives us an idea of how frequent physical activity is happen. Level 1 is little to none, a sedentary predicament. Level 2 can be minor walking at work with still sedentary attributes. Level 3 involves brisk walks or standing for long periods. Level 4 includes walking, lifting, and all day movement. Humans equally put in work at their jobs that contribute to the physical activity data. 

If one's lifespan exceeds 65 years old, plateaus in weight difference amongst men become common. However a normal weight is still acheieved  for both genders which is a good sign of self-awareness. Yet men become more underweight than when they became adults. The obesity datasheet doesn't include diseases, pregnancies, medications, or other factrs that add to the weight category of human lifespan.
